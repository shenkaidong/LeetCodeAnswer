## Overview

- **Purpose**: Document and share my LeetCode practice process, including problem solutions, approaches, and thoughts.
- **Language**: Solutions are primarily written in Java.
- **Tool**: Solutions are submitted using the [LeetCode Editor plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14465-leetcode-editor) in IntelliJ IDEA.
- **Progress**: Track my progress through LeetCode problem sets.
